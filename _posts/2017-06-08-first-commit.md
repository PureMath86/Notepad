# Hi There!!!

Welcome to my blog! ...and the first post. Let me just start off with --I hate HTML and everything about web-design. Ok. I feel better.

My name's Bryan. I'm a mathematician turned data scientist. Be prepared to experience many ramblings here. But despite the insanity there should be some interesting material in the posts to come. Something for everyone --something the whole family can enjoy-- like: 

* how to data science,
* how to yoga,
* how to Python (and various other languages), 
* how to math, 
* Machine Learning algorithms, 
* genetic algorithms,  
* how to money --with cryptocurrencies, 
* how to human, 
* etc.

My personal interests are:

* Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations and Diophantine Equations,
* Algebraic Number Theory,
* Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and General AI,
* Group Theory ang the Group Word Problem,
* Meta-Mathematics, Logic, and Computatbility Theory,
* the Riemann Hypothesis --interpreted through the lense of "elementary" reformulations. E.g., the RH is true if and only if
$$
\sigma(n) \leq H_n + \exp(H_n)\log(H_n)
$$
holds for every $n \geq 1$, where $\sigma$ is the sum of divisors function and '$H_n$' is the $n^{th}$ harmonic number.

* Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD),
* Quantum Computation and [Ancilla Verification --I received an acknowledgement here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04057),
* Knot Theory (Rational Knots) and Applications in Biology,
* Meta-Physics.
