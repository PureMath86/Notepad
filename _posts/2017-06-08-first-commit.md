# BAM!!!

Welcome to my blog! ...and the first post. Let me just start off with --I hate HTML and everything about web-design. Ok. I feel better.

My name's Bryan. I'm a mathematician turned data scientist. Be prepared to experience many ramblings here in the posts to come. Despite the insanity there should be some interesting material in the posts to come. Something for everyone --something the whole family can enjoy-- like: 
* how to data science,
* how to yoga,
* how to Python (and various other languages), 
* how to math, 
* Machine Learning algorithms, 
* genetic algorithms,  
* how to money --with cryptocurrencies, 
* how to human, 
* etc.
I make no apologies for my tongue-in-cheek style. Deal with it! I iS dIamonD-iN-tHe-rOUgH.
